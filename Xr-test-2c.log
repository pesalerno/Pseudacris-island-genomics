3145 (of 3145) markers to be included from [ Xr-test-2b.map ]
Warning, found 92 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ Xr-test-2c.nosex ]
92 individuals read from [ Xr-test-2b.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 92 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 92 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 3145 SNPs
92 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.815812
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
2027 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0.02 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1118 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 92 missing
