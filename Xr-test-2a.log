83445 (of 83445) markers to be included from [ Xr-03-22-NEW.map ]
Warning, found 141 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ Xr-test-2a.nosex ]
141 individuals read from [ Xr-03-22-NEW.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 141 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 141 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 83445 SNPs
141 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.301829
80300 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 0.4 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 3145 SNPs
