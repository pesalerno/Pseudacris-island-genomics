Removed 753 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 3345448 loci.
Kept 3344695 loci, composed of 324930375 sites; 0 of those sites were filtered, 1183704 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 97.15bp (stderr 0.01).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  1: 20.506 samples per locus; pi: 0.32611; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 324930375/1183704/1183704; private alleles: 0
