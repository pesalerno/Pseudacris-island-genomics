# Pseudacris-island-genomics
Following workflow is for processing raw data from RADseq libraries. Two "sets" of libraries were made, one with higher depth of coverage and paired-end reads, and another with lower coverage and single-end. The higher coverage reads will be used for generating a reference genome. Thus, this pipeline actually runs Stacks three separate times:
- First: denovo_map for paired-end reads (Step 1.4)
- Second: ref_map for single-end reads (Step 3)
- Third: rxstacks for fixing genotyping errors with population statistics (Step 4). 

## Step 1: de-multiplexing

######1.1. De-multiplex each library individually
De-multiplexing was done with program [process_radtags](http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/comp/process_radtags.php) individually for each library within its directory, and renamed with sample names within Stacks ([here](https://github.com/pesalerno/Pseudacris-island-genomics/blob/master/barcodes-1933.txt) is an example barcodes file). 

- Commands for process_radtags for the two Paired-end libraries were:

		process_radtags -P -p ./PE-lib-1610/ -b barcodes-1610.txt -i gzfastq - \
		o ./processed-1610/ -e sbfI -c -q -r -D
	(example for library #1610 for *Xanthusia*)
- Commands for process_radtags for all the other single-end libraries were:

		process_radtags -p ./SR-lib5-1994/ -b barcodes-1994.txt -i gzfastq \ 
		-o ./processed-1994/ -e sbfI -c -q -r -D
	(example for library #1994 for shared *Xanthusia* and *Pseudacris*)


######1.3. Merge all libraries into single directory

Copy all renamed libraries for all individuals into their "species" directories (up to this point we had one library where *Xanthusia* and *Pseudacris* were mixed together - library #1994)




##Step 2: create reference genome with PE reads

######2.1. Run denovo_map program for paired-end reads

Run in Stacks the script [denovo_map](http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/comp/denovo_map.php) with libraries with higher depth of coverage and paired-end reads for creating the reference genome. I'm trying to be highly conservative about the flag parameters. 

	> denovo_map.pl -m 3 -M 1 -n 0 -T 16 -b 1 -t -S -o ./denovo-1/ \


From Hohenlohe et al. 2013: *"We grouped the forward and reverse reads from all individuals in these populations into a separate file for each RAD locus, using the STACKS program sort_read_pairs.pl"*

More from Hohenlohe et al. 2013: *"We created a catalog of RAD tag loci using cstacks and matched indi- viduals against the catalog using sstacks. We populated and indexed a MYSQL database of loci using load_ radtags.pl and index_radtags.pl and then exported the data using export_sql.pl. Finally, we grouped the for- ward and reverse reads from each individual corre- sponding to each RAD locus using sort_read_pairs.pl."*

More from Hohenlohe et al. 2013: *"We assembled the reads in each file separately to produce a set of RAD contigs (Fig. 2b), using both VELVET (Zerbino & Bir- ney 2008) and CAP3 (Huang & Madan 1999) assembly software."*

###Intermediate step: get a quick SNP matrix only with SR sequences for Chris' report

######1. check to see which files are repeats in different libraries, or else when moving them to do denovo_map they will be rewritten/lost.

Libraries #1612 and #1835 are essentially duplicates, with few exceptions. Library #1834 is mostly unique with a few that are repeats from #1612. So, I'm renaming all sequence files and adding a -1.fq.gz to library #1 (1612), -2.fq.gz to library 2 (1834), and so on. Remaming all files at once using the following code:

	rename .fq.gz -1.fq.gz *.fq.gz
	
	

######2. purge PCR duplicates from within each file

I need to run the perl script [purge_PCR_duplicates.pl](https://github.com/claudiuskerth/scripts_for_RAD/blob/master/purge_PCR_duplicates.pl). When I try to run it on Dan's server, it says the following error message:

	> purge_PCR_duplicates.pl requires the CPAN module Parallel::ForkManager. Please install this package and add it 
	> to your Perl library path.

I need to install the module [Parallel::ForkManager](http://search.cpan.org/~dlux/Parallel-ForkManager-0.7.5/ForkManager.pm) but the website manual is not very easy to understand.... need to figure this out. ---> probably needs intalling in root, already emailed Dan

######3. Merge fasta files for library duplicates

After being renamed, move all files back to the SR-denovo-prelim folder and there I merge the fasta files. I merge with the following [code](http://www.researchgate.net/post/How_do_I_merge_several_multisequence-fasta_files_to_create_one_tree_for_subsequent_Unifrac_analysis):

*To merge several files use the SHELL, go to your folder where the files are and use the cat command. E.g. to merge seqfile001.fasta, seqfile002.fasta and seqfile003.fasta type*

	cat seqfile001.fasta seqfile002.fasta seqfile003.fasta > seqcombined.fasta


*or if you have more files use*

	cat *.fasta > seqcombined.fasta

---> May want to run [exec_velvet.pl](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp/exec_velvet.php) to generate collated fasta file for reference genome.

Use the output consensus sequence file from denovo_map (*"catalogs.tags.tsv"*) and transform to fasta format for input into [bwa](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml), using Kelly's R script (need to modify once I run it):

	
	# Import the data and check the structure
	tags<-read.table('batch_1.catalog.tags.tsv', header=FALSE)
	# all the sequences are in $V9

	unique(tags$V2) # sample ID is meaningless here
	length(unique(tags$V3)) #417153 -- each row has a unique locus ID

	# verify that all of the tags are consensus:
	consensus.tags<-subset(tags, V6=='consensus')
	length(consensus.tags[,1]) #417153
	length(tags[,1]) #417153

	# each sequence needs a fasta header to uniquely identify it
	fa.id<-paste('>', tags$V3, '_pseudoreference_pe_concatenated_without_rev_complement', sep='')

	fa<-cbind(fa.id, as.character(tags$V9))
	write.table(fa, file='D_variabilis_denovo_psuedoreference.fa', quote=FALSE, sep='\n', row.names=FALSE,
            col.names=FALSE)
 

######2.2. Index reference genome and align in bwa

Create reference genome from fasta consensus sequences:

	> bwa index paired-end.fasta

Then align all of the de-multiplexed files (single-end 100bp reads) to reference genome:

	> bwa mem -t 6 paired-end.fasta all-reads-demultiplexed.fq > align-allRADs.sam
	
Transform .sam file to .bam file for visualization in IGV:

	> module load samtools
	> samtools view -b -S -o 454-align.bam 454-align.sam
	> samtools sort 454-align.bam 454-align.sorted
	> samtools index 454-align.sorted.bam

Visualize in IGV

Use either .sam or .bam alignment for input in ref_map.pl

##Step 3: Map to new reference genome in Stacks

Use ref_map.pl for mapping the raw read files to the reference genome we created using the in-depth paired-end reads plus the single-end reads of all individuals.

	> ref_map.pl -o /path/for/output -n 2 -m 2 -T 12 -O popmap.txt -b 1 -S -s ./all-sequences-here\

##Step 4: Filter data with haplotype corrections in Stacks

Here we essentially re-run the stacks pipeline (post-demultiplexing) to make corrections based on population haplotype statistics (reduced probability of obtainind fake haplotypes created by paralog stacks and PCR duplicate errors)

	> rxstacks -b 1 -P ./input-stacksoutput/ -o /new-output-path/ --prune_haplo --lnl_filter --lnl_dist
